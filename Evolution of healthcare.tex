\section{Introduction}
A health care system is an organization of people,institutions and resouces that delivers the health care services to meet the health of the needed populations.Hospitals were designed to deliver healthcare in the 19th century.The technological advances in medicines in late 20th century made a system designed to take care of patients and admitted them for bed rest and for recuperation.The hospital was constructed around the needs of specialist doctors, whoin return for giving their time freely had their own wards, operating theaters, recovery areas, nursing staff, and medical teams.During old times patients were cared for within the limits of what was available.Pain relief was possible but curative drugs and medicines were very rare.And diagnostic services were limited to simple X-rays and basic blood tests.
\section{19th-Century}
Public health measurea were developed highly during the nineteenth century as the rapid growth of cities required systematic sanitary measures.Advanced research centers opened in the early twentieth century connected major hospitals.In the mid-twentieth century new biological treatments was made along with developments in chemistry,genetics and lab technology which led to modern medicines and healthcare.Which also opened new careers such nurses for women and as physicians and also disease specialization arised in providing medical care with respect to the specific characteristics of the disease as well as provided rise in specialized medical professionals.

Around the late 1940s, healthcare system changed and has continued to evolve to the present day.New and improved antibiotics were developed,new drugs became available,chemotherapy,radiotherapy,dialysis and better diagnostic procedures helped us to image and understand much of the body's diseases.And a number of noninvasive and invasive surgical option were discovered and expanded. 
 
\section{21st-century}
 The twenty-first century was when there was highly advancement and researches in numerous fields of science.These very technological breakthroughs,which includes the invention of semi-conductors,the increase in computational power with the lower cost of energy and power of technologies were the main factors for the start of personalized medicine.Applications such as microarrays and next generation sequencing(NGS) provided health care based on the patients profile without the use high input of screening methods.Also with the help of physics,mathematics and engineering it was possible to interpret genomic data.

Further on,pioneering work in engineering has created new possibilities through the application of biosensors,3d-printing,nanoparticles and nano-bots also advanced imaging methodologies,as well as improved procedures towards the understanding of biological signal transduction and information transmission.This interdisciplinary interaction gave the new possibility of predicting the health risks of an individual based on his/hers genomic profile and dna structure.At the same time,new analytical tools
were founded which gave the chance of treating human diseases from holistic perspective.
\section{The Future}
The future of healthcare system is likely to be driven by digital transformation enabled by radically interoperable data,artifical interlligence(AI), and open, secure platforms.We can expect the prevention and early diagnoses of diseases.Today's wearable devices which is used to track our vitals will become invisible such that always-on sensors will be embedded in the devices that surrounds us.In this way individuals will have access to their own detailed information on their health data and can make decision about their health and well-being on their own.
